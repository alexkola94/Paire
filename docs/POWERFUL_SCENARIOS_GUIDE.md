## 🧮 Advanced Calculations

### Loan Payoff Formula
```csharp
// Amortization calculation with extra payments
while (balance > 0 && months < maxMonths)
{
    interest = balance * monthlyInterestRate;
    principalPayment = min(monthlyPayment - interest, balance);
    balance -= principalPayment;
    totalInterest += interest;
    months++;
}
```

### Compound Interest Formula
```csharp
// Future Value = P(1 + r/n)^(nt) + PMT * (((1 + r/n)^(nt) - 1) / (r/n))
// Where:
// P = Principal (initial amount)
// PMT = Monthly contribution
// r = Annual interest rate
// n = Compounds per year
// t = Years
```

### Debt Avalanche Method
- Sort debts by interest rate (highest first)
- Pay minimums on all debts
- Apply extra payments to highest rate debt
- Once paid off, roll payment to next highest
- Continue until debt-free
