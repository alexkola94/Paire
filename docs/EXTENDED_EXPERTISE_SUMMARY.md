**📱 The 24-Hour Rule**
Wait 24 hours before any non-essential purchase over $50. 
Most impulse urges fade.

**🍔 The Latte Factor**
Small daily expenses add up! $5/day = $1,825/year. 
Make coffee at home, save $1,500+.

**🎯 The 50/30/20 Rule**
50% Needs, 30% Wants, 20% Savings. 
Simple framework for balanced budgeting.

that increases income by $10K = 1000% return.

🎓 Warren Buffett's Wisdom:
• "Do not save what is left after spending; 
   spend what is left after saving."
• "The most important investment you can make 
   is in yourself."
